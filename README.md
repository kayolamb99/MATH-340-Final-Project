# Math 340 Final Project

Analysis of Firefighter deaths towards the completion of my Applied Statistical Methods II course as part
of a group project. Conducted analysis using R statistical software, detailing main insights in our Written Final
Report and Presentation Deck

## Data:

Downloaded data directly from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/fema/firefighter-fatalities), with the original 
source being from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) The dataset came pre-cleaned, with minimal cleaning necessary
to complete our project.

However, in order to isolate the effects of the September 11 attacks on first responders, we removed this portion
of the data from our set and conducted analysis on it separately. We utilized the sqldf package to accomlplish this result

## Insights:

Main insights can be found in our final report, with detailed descriptions of models utilized and fit statistics
